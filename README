Z(1)                             User Commands                            Z(1)



NAME
       z - jump around

SYNOPSIS
       z [-cehlrtx] [regex1 regex2 ... regexn]

AVAILABILITY
       PowerShell (Windows)

DESCRIPTION
       Tracks your most used directories, based on 'frecency'.

       After  a  short  learning  phase, z will take you to the most 'frecent'
       directory that matches ALL of the regexes given on the command line, in
       order.

       For example, z foo bar would match C:\foo\bar but not C:\bar\foo.

OPTIONS
       -c     restrict matches to subdirectories of the current directory

       -e     echo the best match, don't cd

       -h     show a brief help message

       -l     list only

       -r     match by rank only

       -t     match by recent access only

       -x     remove the current directory from the datafile

EXAMPLES
       z foo         cd to most frecent dir matching foo

       z foo bar     cd to most frecent dir matching foo, then bar

       z -r foo      cd to highest ranked dir matching foo

       z -t foo      cd to most recently accessed dir matching foo

       z -l foo      list all dirs matching foo (by frecency)

NOTES
   Installation:
       Put something like this in your PowerShell $PROFILE:

              . C:\path\to\z.ps1

       cd around for a while to build up the db.

       Optionally:
              Set $_Z_CMD to change the command name (default z).
              Set $_Z_DATA to change the datafile (default $HOME\.z).
              Set  $_Z_MAX_SCORE  lower  to  age  entries  out faster (default
              9000).
              Set $_Z_EXCLUDE_DIRS to an array of directory trees to  exclude.
              (These  settings  should  go  in  your PowerShell profile before
              the line added above.)

              Example settings:
              $env:_Z_CMD = "j"                    # use 'j' instead of 'z'
              $env:_Z_DATA = "$env:USERPROFILE\.zdata"  # custom data file
              $env:_Z_MAX_SCORE = "5000"            # age out faster
              $env:_Z_EXCLUDE_DIRS = "C:\Windows;C:\Temp"  # exclude dirs

   PowerShell Execution Policy:
       If you get execution policy errors, you may need to set your execution
       policy to allow scripts:

              Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

       Or run with bypass:

              powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File z.ps1

   Aging:
       The rank of directories maintained by z undergoes aging based on a sim-
       ple formula. The rank of each entry is incremented  every  time  it  is
       accessed.  When the sum of ranks is over 9000, all ranks are multiplied
       by 0.99. Entries with a rank lower than 1 are forgotten.

   Frecency:
       Frecency is a portmanteau of 'recent' and 'frequency'. It is a weighted
       rank  that depends on how often and how recently something occurred. As
       far as I know, Mozilla came up with the term.

       To z, a directory that has low ranking but has been  accessed  recently
       will  quickly  have  higher rank than a directory accessed frequently a
       long time ago.

       Frecency is determined at runtime.

   Common:
       When multiple directories match all queries, and they all have a common
       prefix, z will cd to the shortest matching directory, without regard to
       priority.  This has been in effect, if  undocumented,  for  quite  some
       time, but should probably be configurable or reconsidered.

   Tab Completion:
       z  supports tab completion in PowerShell. After any number of arguments,
       press TAB to complete on directories that match each argument. The  
       completion is handled by PowerShell's Register-ArgumentCompleter.

ENVIRONMENT
       A function Invoke-Z() is defined.

       The contents of the variable $_Z_CMD is aliased to Invoke-Z. If not set,
       $_Z_CMD defaults to z.

       The  environment  variable $_Z_DATA can be used to control the datafile
       location. If it is not defined, the location defaults to $HOME\.z.

       The environment variable $_Z_EXCLUDE_DIRS can be set to a  semicolon-
       separated list of directory trees to exclude from tracking. $HOME is  
       always excluded. Directories must be full paths without trailing slashes.

       Example: $env:_Z_EXCLUDE_DIRS = "C:\Windows;C:\Program Files;C:\Temp"

       In PowerShell, z hooks into the prompt function to maintain its database.
       The original prompt is preserved and called after updating z's data.

FILES
       Data is stored in $HOME\.z. This  can  be  overridden  by  setting  the
       $_Z_DATA environment variable. When initialized, z will raise an error
       if this path is a directory, and not function correctly.

       Data format is: path|rank|time
       Example: C:\foo\bar|5|1735089600
